# HeartDiseasePredictor_SFI_Hackathon
The team developing a health theme app for the "Solving for India" hackathon hosted by GFG. It is focused on creating a heart disease predictor. The app aims to assist users in predicting the likelihood of developing heart disease based on various risk factors, such as age, gender, family history, lifestyle, and medical history. The team comprises experienced developers, data scientists, and healthcare professionals who are passionate about leveraging technology to improve healthcare outcomes in India.

The team is committed to creating an app that is easy to use, intuitive, and accessible to all. They plan to incorporate cutting-edge technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, to develop a robust heart disease prediction algorithm. The app will also provide users with personalized recommendations to lower their risk of developing heart disease, such as healthy diet and exercise habits, stress management techniques, and regular medical check-ups.

The team is acutely aware of the prevalence of heart disease in India, which is one of the leading causes of death in the country. Their app aims to empower individuals with the knowledge and tools to take proactive steps towards preventing heart disease and improving their overall health and wellbeing. Through their work, the team hopes to make a meaningful impact on the lives of millions of people across India, particularly those from marginalized communities who may have limited access to healthcare resources.
